# Problem

- too many hackathon websites to search for a beginner
- no alerts when a new hackathon is added
- low moderation hackathon servers gets spammed

# Potential Solution

- Get all hackathon updates in the server you are in
- One command for one website you want to search
- set a warn threshold, after it's crossed the user gets banned
